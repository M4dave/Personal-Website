Having clear, time-based goals helps me stay focused and productive. Whether they’re daily tasks or long-term aspirations, setting specific goals keeps you on track and motivated.Starting projects is easy, but finishing them requires persistence. Don’t leave things half-done; push through the challenges and complete what i've started. The value lies in delivering the finished product. I need allocate more time than necessary for a task, it tends to stretch out. Set realistic deadlines and maintain focus to avoid unnecessary delays.
